# Jsdoom Code of Conduct

The jsdoom code of conduct is based on the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://microsoft.github.io/codeofconduct/).

### Why does this code of conduct exist?

The code of conduct describes the expected behavior of those who participate in jsdoom discussion and development. The code of conduct applies not only to individuals' behavior as it is directly related to jsdoom, but also applies to their behavior in other settings.

The purpose of this code of conduct is primarily to maintain a professional and positive manner of interaction between contributors and, secondarily, to ensure that the project is externally represented by people who act in a respectful and professional way toward others.

### What happens if someone violates the code of conduct?

Those who act in contradiction to this code of conduct will be warned about their behavior. Where applicable, offenders will be asked to apologize or make other reparations. Those who violate the code of conduct in especially heinous ways, who violate it repeatedly, or who refuse to make appropriate reparations for harmful actions may be banned from participating in the project.

Disciplinary or remedial actions will be made at the discretion of maintainers, i.e. those who have write access to the jsdoom git repository. Disciplinary or remedial action may include revoking repository privileges or outright bans, temporary or indefinite. Discipline should be in proportion to an individual's offenses.

### What do I do if someone is acting inappropriately?

Please privately contact the maintainers about behavior which violates the code of conduct so that remedial actions can be taken. At the time of writing, the best way to do this is to send an email to the sole maintainer via sophiek (at) pineapplemachine (dot) com.

### How is appropriate or inappropriate behavior defined?

Appropriate behavior is that which leads to a constructive and professional environment. Inappropriate behavior is that which excludes or hurts others.

Here are some more specific guidelines:

#### Be professional

If you wouldn't do it in a professional setting, then you shouldn't do it here. Be polite and respectful.

#### Be patient

Remember that others may not be fluent in the language in which you are communicating, or may not yet share your level of understanding of the concepts being discussed. Constructively criticize contributions so the software may be the best that it can be, but be mindful that your criticism does not take the form of derision or insults.

#### Be welcoming

It is important that people of any culture, background, or identity feel welcome here. Refrain from using exclusive or offensive language.

#### Examples of exemplary behavior

- ✓ Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- ✓ Be patient and understanding.
- ✓ Respect the privacy of others.
- ✓ Gracefully accept criticism.

#### Examples of unacceptable behavior

- ✗ Do not use derogatory or discriminatory language.
- ✗ Do not use violent language or issue threats.
- ✗ Do not share others' personal information. (Don't "dox" them.)
- ✗ Do not insult or harass others.
- ✗ Do not post sexually explicit material; this is not the place for it.
- ✗ Do not feed the trolls. Notify a maintainer instead.
